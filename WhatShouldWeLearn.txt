Machine Learning

1. Linear Algebra
2. Calculus
3. Statistic & Probabilty
#MIT Open Course have all three above

Python and R are both good with Machine Learning
Python	-Data Science From Scratch(book)
R	-Machine Learning with R(book)


A lot of time spending on these section:
-Find Data(Webscrape,APIs,CSVs)
-Clean the data( remove NaNs and Infinities, and string and so on).
-Scikit Learn Cheet Sheet
